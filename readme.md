# Transitor Listor 

## Abstract 

Transistor Listor is portofolio project presenting an iOS based application implementing a List - Detail view paradigm.  As the name implies, with a twist on the verb Lister, the application presents a list of various transistors with the option to delve into the details of a specific part with a simple tap.

## Architecture

The application uses the common *MVVM* UI architecture for the presentation layer.  A model collection is also implemented for managing domain elements and a services layer for retrieving and parsing JSON formatted transistor data.
